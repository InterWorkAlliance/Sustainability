# Measurement or Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV)

Measurement or Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) is the process in which ecological benefit claims or disclosures are validated, verified and ultimately tokenized in an ecological market. The MRV process is based on the type of benefit or disclosure being made. The process itself though, can be made into a framework that can describe all variations of MRV and be used as a baseline for understanding the process.

## MRV Framework

A framework to describe the MRV process consists of the following entities, roles and steps:

- Entities:
  - Verification Standard - has a protocol or methodology version for the scope and  type of benefit or disclosure being made, i.e.,  Forestry & Land Use, Afforestation/Reforestation OR Agriculture, Manure Methane Digester. This standard describes the MRV technical specifications as to what data is required and when.
  - A Benefit Claim Token - is a tokenized benefit claim issued by a [MBP](ep.md)
  - Verification Contract - the MRV agreement between an EP, VVB and a Standard Registry for the EP to submit benefit claims, the VVB to validate and verify the claims and the Standard Registry to issue credits and/or tokens based on the results.

- Roles:
  - role 1
  - role 2

- Steps:
  - step 1
  - step 2
